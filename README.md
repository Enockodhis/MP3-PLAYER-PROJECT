# MP3-PLAYER-PROJECT
This project covers fundamental concepts such as handling audio playback, managing a playlist, implementing play, pause, next, previous, and shuffle functionalities. I managed to dynamically update the music player user interface based on the current song. Here is hyperlink to this project: https://musicplayerprojectmp3.netlify.app/
